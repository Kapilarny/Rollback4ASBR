# Rollback4ASBR
A project that aims to implement Rollback Netcode into JoJo All-Star Battle R

## STATUS: RESEARCH ðŸ”Ž

## Motivation
Since CC2 basically killed this ultra fun game with their oh so great delay networking and shown no kind of signs to even fix some of the current netcode bugs (f.e. random game crashes while connecting to match), itâ€™s now time to hack the game so we can get a decent online experience with a more modern approach (at least weâ€™ll try).
